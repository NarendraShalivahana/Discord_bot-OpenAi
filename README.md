# A Discord bot integrated with OpenAI API

Trademate can be added to a discord server and can provide features of ChatGPT inside that discord server. 
Implemented 4 commands:
- $chat - responds to your messages
- $code - most efficient in giving codes
- $complete - efficient in writing blogs, articles, letters etc
- $edit - efficient in fixing the grammatical errors in a sentence

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome!

You can append a new command by making a .js file in [commandHandlers](/handlers/commandHandlers) folder. 

It will be a custom js module which must export these 3 parameters: ```command, execute, description```.

```command``` will store the command string.

```execute``` is a function which has the logic for the command. It has 2 parameters- ```message``` ```args```.

```description``` it will have the description of the command.

Example code snippet:

```
const openai = require("./../../src/ai.js");

const command = "chat"; 
const description = "$chat : It will return the response for the given prompt. e.g. $chat <prompt>";

const execute = (message, agrs) => {
    //logic for the command
}

module.exports =  {command, execute, description};

```

Thank you
